# Hamedal Software Development Kit (SDK)

## Prerequisites
Hamedal SDK supportes the following node versions: 

- 13.0.0

Hamedal SDK supportes the following electron versions: 

- 7.2.1

We recommend using nvm as your node version manager [https://github.com/creationix/nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

After you've setup nvm run
```
  nvm use 13.0.0
```

## Get started
Then you can install and start using the huddly sdk you need first install it and the transport
```
  npm install @hamedal-falcon
```

Start by creating the sdk and the transport

```javascript
var Hamedal = require('hamedal-sdk-test');

var cameras = Hamedal.devices();

// Create instances of hamedal device you want to use
var falcon = new Hamedal.FalconCamera(cameraInfo);

Then you should be good to go. All the actions on the cameraManager are done after the attach event. For example, to change the camera model, call `setAIMode` when the camera is attached.

```
falcon.enableAIMode().then(value => {
  console.log(value);
}).catch(reason => {
  console.log(reason);
});
```
